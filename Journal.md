1. What did we do?
2. What did you learn?
1. What question do I have?

Answer
1. We made an argorithm for Mr. Ruben to make his breakfast by using two kinds of jam, bread and two knives.
2. I learned how much we are depending on the shared knowledge previously. Also, I learned that we have to use a unversal language which everyone can understand precisely.
3. How much information do I have to put into the computer? What kind of system does it have?



1, We played with degital dices. It was very hard to guess the correct number. It was even doubtful if we ordered correctly.

It was confusing for me to recognize what kind of variables or orders I should use since I hardky have knowledge about it. However, I'm getting how it works litttle by little.

How your personal computer can help science battle the coronavirus while you sleep:

I'm for the idea that people can cooperate with reasearch while they are sleeping. In these days, computer is greatly contributing to many science research. However, at the same time, biology is rvery complex compared to other fields of science. I feel that the risk participants may take is small because university or other responsible science institution would lead the researches. therefore, I agree with the computer contribution.

I learned that abstraction is an effective way for simulation. I found it interesting because it is similar to models in science. To abstract something, we have to see the essence of things: what is important and what is not, or what really mattters. In this case, we regarded people as a simple moving point. I think that's because what we need to know is just the interaction between moving people. I'm looking forward to going next step.
